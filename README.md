Video extension Artemisa V9958 with CXA2075 (Composiet)

V9958 for Artemisa(Made Alvaro Polo) [Artemisa MSX Project](https://github.com/apoloval/artemisa)

I made an Video Extension for the Artemisa with an V9958 and en CXA2075(for Composiet out).
Which works fine in MSX1 modus, however I also want it to work with MSX2 Modus (screen4 to 8).
Have tried a cartridge with a lot of rom's for V9958 and an MSX2 Rom's on the mainboard, but that did not work out.
